I'm excited to share my latest project - **Next Pizza**, a pizza ordering web application that I've been working on. While it's still a work in progress, I wanted to document what I've built so far and share some insights from the development process.

## What is Next Pizza?

Next Pizza is a modern web application for browsing and ordering pizzas, sauces, and drinks. The app features:

- An interactive product catalog with detailed information
- A fully functional shopping cart system
- Smooth navigation between different product categories
- A clean, responsive interface with an orange-themed design

## Tech Stack

For this project, I chose to work with:

- **Next.js 14+** with the App Router for the framework
- **React** with functional components and hooks
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Context API** for state management (shopping cart)
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

## Key Learnings

Working on this project has been a great learning experience. Here are some of the main takeaways:

### 1. State Management

Implementing the shopping cart with React Context API taught me how to manage global state effectively and share data between components.

### 2. Component Design

Creating reusable components like `CardTile` for products helped me understand the importance of component composition and props.

### 3. UI/UX Considerations

Designing features like auto-opening the cart when users add items showed me how small details can significantly improve user experience.

### 4. Styling with Tailwind

I learned to leverage Tailwind's utility classes for rapid UI development while maintaining consistency across the app.

### 5. Next.js App Router

Getting hands-on experience with Next.js's latest routing paradigm and understanding how to structure a modern React application.

## Work in Progress

This project is still evolving! Some features I'm planning to add:

- [ ] Backend integration for real order processing
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Order history
- [ ] Payment integration
- [ ] More product customization options

Building Next Pizza has been an exciting journey of learning and experimentation. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to develop and refine this application!
