## An honest confession

I’ll be honest — I’ve been using AI to generate my posts, but I’ve decided that from today on I’ll write them myself, in my own words and with my own mistakes xd  
Why? Because personally, I prefer reading content that feels more human, whatever that actually means.

## What’s next?

I added Storybook to the NextPizza project, although I’m still not sure if I really need it. The app uses a relatively small number of components and visual variations. To truly take advantage of Storybook’s potential, I should probably use it in a more ambitious project. But which one?

For now, I have one idea. I noticed that websites like _justjoin.it_ don’t have a dedicated mobile app, so I’m planning to build a recruitment app loosely inspired by their platform.

## Unit tests

I also added unit tests to the entire application using Vitest and Copilot — don’t worry, I understand what I’m pasting in.  
That said, if I had to write these tests completely from scratch by hand, it would definitely take me much more time, so I use AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.
